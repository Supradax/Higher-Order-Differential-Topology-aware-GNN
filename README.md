# (NeurIPS2025 $\textcolor{blue}{SPOTLIGHT}$) Higher-Order-Differential-Topology-aware-GNN 
The code of the proposed model DEC-HOGNN on the benchmark 2D-electrostatics is offered, as shown in Table 2 in our paper.  The code doesn't need any extra dependency except for popular libraries like `pytorch`,`numpy` and some python standard libraries. 

### Instructions
Class `HOGNNDataset` in `datagen2D.py` has encapsulated all stuff that DEC-HOGNN requires (like adjacencies, volumes, boundary markers, whitney elements etc). The training, validation and test datasets have been already partitioned in ./data. The training code lies in `main.py` and some auxilary classes are in `basics.py`. 

## Datasets
![Logo](imgs/dataset.jpg)
The datasets mentioned in the paper are offered here, which are generated by Ansys Maxwell. Some key attributes in the 2D datasets are depicted here. The 3D ones are likewise:
- `pedge_vol,pface_vol,vedge_vol,vface_vol`: the volume (edge length, face area) of the primal / dual elements. Nodes volume are directly set 1. 
- `edge_tangents, dual_edge_tangents`: the unit vector indicating the edge direction
- `edge_whitney_vec, dedge_whitney_vec`: the whitney element of each edge $w_i\nabla\mathbf{w}_j-w_j\nabla\mathbf{w}_i$， where $\mathbf w_i$ is the canonical hat function in FEM(finite element method)
- `is_bdry_node, is_bdry_edge, is_bdry_face`: the binary boundary mask
- `node_node_upper_idx, edge_edge_lower_idx, edge_edge_upper_idx, face_face_lower_idx,edge_node_idx,face_edge_idx`: various adjacencies mentioned in our paper
- `edge_idx, face_idx, vedge_idx`: the index of the elements
- `p_x, d_x, p_y, d_y`: `p/d` indicates primal / dual grpahs; `x` is the input (masked fields) while `y` is the output. The `p_x` in `2Dele` dataset has 5-dim attributes: the intensity, displacement and charge density $\mathbf E, \mathbf D, \rho$ while it is the intensity ,flux and current density $\mathbf H, \amthbf B, j$ in magnetic datasets.

### Quick Start
A trained model within 500 epochs is provided. You can load the parameters and run the test function by simply typing in the command:

`python main.py --gpu=0 --mode=1`

You can also choose to train the model by: 

` python main.py --gpu=0 --mode=0`
